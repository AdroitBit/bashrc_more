# bashrc_more
This is my custom bashrc.<br>
I'm interested in Robotic Engineering so my bashrc setup is around that topic.<br>
And this is designed for WSL with Ubuntu 20.04<br>


### Installation
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/VeryHardBit/bashrc_more
echo -e '\nsource ~/bashrc_more/setup.bash\n' >> ~/.bashrc
```
